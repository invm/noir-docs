## Exporting CSV or JSON array data

After a query is ran and has results, you will see two new buttons appear:

<img src={exportimg} width={250} />

By clicking any of the button, a prompt will appear to select download location.

:::tip
Try exporting also with <button>Ctrl/Cmd</button> + <button>C/J</button>.

C stands for CSV and J for JSON.
:::

JSON array just exports all results serielized as json object in an array.
